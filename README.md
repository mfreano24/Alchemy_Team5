Defeat an enemy to gain EXP and/or get its elements.
Use those elements to make more potions to defeat more enemies.
Gain enough EXP to level up: (Use WASD to select a buff and press space to select it)
After wave 9, the enemies are randomly generated!

POTIONS:
Sulfur - Enemies take damage over time! Is it hot in here?
Nitrogen - Slow it all down for a sec!
Oxygen - Get a little extra push when you're being chased!

Each of these have a "Greater" potion, crafted with 2 of the base potion.

What happens if you craft two different potions together?
Sulfur + Nitrogen - Things get a little more explosive.
Nitrogen + Oxygen - Let's do the time warp again.
Sulfur + Oxygen - Everything seems to be melting.

ENEMIES:
Basic Slime: Do not touch. Pretty cute, though.
Fire Slime: A little spicier. Drops sulfur.
Nitroshroom: Things get a little slower when you touch these. Drops nitrogen.

Some enemies react with your potions and explode!
- Fire Slime + Nitrogen potion?
- Nitroshroom + Sulfur Potion?
